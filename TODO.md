# Calculator application

Make the following additions to the calculator. Order is optional!


### Add numbers: Make the + button work

This is the simplest one of them, might be a good place to start!


### Substract numbers: Make the - button work

Note that the order matters!


### Multiply numbers: Make the * button work

The second easiest of them all.


### Divide numbers: Make the / button work

Note that the order matters in this too!


### Divide numbers: Make the = button work

Could this be a recursion?
Note that this might create an infinite loop quite easily ;) 


### Decimal numbers: Make the , button work

Thougths that might be handy:
- Type of number - string or a double? float? For this you likely need to use ClojureScript's JavaScript interop!

- Is the "," -button really an action button? 
- Is the "," -button really a "," or "."?


### Add negative/positive number button

Add a "+/-" -button so that it will be possible to insert negative numbers.


### Last selected action improvements 

Disable the last clicked action and make it visible for example by a background color change.


### Reset calculation without page refresh

Add a reset button to restart the calculation.


### Add memory button

Memorize the last calculation.
